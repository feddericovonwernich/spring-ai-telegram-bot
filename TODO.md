## Stuff to do:
* Write some javadocs.
* Implement some kind of changelog automation.
* Implement automatic versioning.
* Implement release pipeline on release branches. This pipeline should execute without being a prerelease like main.
* Implement code scanning like Qodana or similar tool.
* Use spring dependency management plugin
* Test autoconfiguration in an implementation on a service where Spring Data JPA is not on the classpath.
